To synthesize N-Acetyl-DL-phenylalanine, you can use one of these straightforward methods:
Method 1: Direct Acetylation of DL-Phenylalanine
Materials Needed:

DL-Phenylalanine
Acetic anhydride
Sodium hydroxide or sodium acetate
Water
pH meter or pH paper

Procedure:

Dissolve 5.0 g of DL-phenylalanine in 50 mL of water containing 3.0 g of sodium hydroxide (or sodium acetate).
Cool the solution to 0-5°C in an ice bath.
Slowly add 5-6 mL of acetic anhydride dropwise while stirring.
Maintain the pH at 8-9 by adding additional NaOH solution as needed (monitor with pH meter).
Continue stirring for 1-2 hours at room temperature.
Acidify the solution to pH 1-2 using concentrated HCl.
Cool the solution to induce crystallization.
Filter the crystals, wash with cold water, and dry to obtain N-Acetyl-DL-phenylalanine.

Method 2: Using Acetyl Chloride
Materials Needed:

DL-Phenylalanine
Acetyl chloride
Dioxane or THF
Sodium bicarbonate solution

Procedure:

Suspend 5.0 g of DL-phenylalanine in 50 mL of dioxane or THF.
Add 50 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution.
Cool the mixture to 0-5°C.
Add 3.5 mL of acetyl chloride dropwise while stirring vigorously.
Allow the reaction to warm to room temperature and stir for 3-4 hours.
Evaporate the organic solvent under reduced pressure.
Acidify the aqueous layer to pH 2 with HCl.
Extract with ethyl acetate (3 × 50 mL).
Dry the organic layer over sodium sulfate, filter, and evaporate to obtain the product.

Method 3: Using Microwave Assistance (Fast Method)
Materials Needed:

DL-Phenylalanine
Acetic anhydride
Microwave reactor (or domestic microwave)

Procedure:

Mix 2.0 g of DL-phenylalanine with 5 mL of acetic anhydride in a microwave-safe vessel.
Heat in a microwave reactor at 80°C for 5 minutes (or in domestic microwave at medium power for 2-3 minutes with monitoring).
Cool the mixture to room temperature.
Pour into ice water and stir for 30 minutes.
Filter the precipitate, wash with cold water, and dry to obtain the product.

The expected yield is typically 70-85% of white crystalline N-Acetyl-DL-phenylalanine.
