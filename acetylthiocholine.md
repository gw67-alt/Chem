To produce **acetylthiocholine**, you would need to perform an acetylation reaction where a **thiocholine** derivative (such as **thiocholine chloride**) is acetylated using **acetic anhydride** as the acetylating agent.

Here's a general outline of how to produce **acetylthiocholine**:

### Materials Needed:
- **Acetic anhydride** (CH₃CO)₂O
- **Thiocholine** (usually prepared from **choline** and **hydrogen sulfide**)
- Solvent (such as chloroform or acetone)
- **Base** (optional, to neutralize any acid formed during the reaction)

### Steps:
1. **Preparation of Thiocholine:**
   Thiocholine can be prepared by reacting **choline** (C₅H₁₃NO₂) with **hydrogen sulfide** (H₂S), which substitutes the oxygen atom in choline's hydroxyl group (-OH) with a sulfur atom (-SH).
   \[
   \text{Choline} + \text{H}_2\text{S} \rightarrow \text{Thiocholine} + \text{Water}
   \]
   
2. **Acetylation of Thiocholine:**
   In a separate flask, mix the **thiocholine** with **acetic anhydride** in a suitable solvent (such as acetone or chloroform). The acetic anhydride will act as an acetylating agent, attaching an acetyl group (CH₃CO) to the sulfur atom of thiocholine.
   
   The reaction can be written as:
   \[
   \text{Thiocholine} + (CH₃CO)_2O \rightarrow \text{Acetylthiocholine} + CH₃COOH
   \]

3. **Work-up:**
   After the reaction has completed, the mixture is usually worked up by neutralizing any remaining acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with a base, and then isolating **acetylthiocholine** by solvent extraction, crystallization, or distillation, depending on the purity and form desired.

### Notes:
- **Safety precautions**: Both acetic anhydride and hydrogen sulfide are hazardous chemicals. Use proper ventilation and protective equipment (gloves, goggles, etc.) when handling them.
- The solvent used should be chosen carefully to ensure that it does not react with acetic anhydride or thiocholine.
  
This is a basic outline of the synthesis process, though the exact conditions (such as solvent choice, temperature, and reaction time) may need to be optimized for best results.
